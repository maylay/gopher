A mostly functional gopher browser for plan9.

Text and submenu items are displayed within the browser, whereas images and documents are opened through page and HTML items sent to the plumber.
Other item types (bin, dos, uuencoded files, etc.) are not implemented yet.

This has not been thoroughly tested so many bugs are just waiting to be found.
